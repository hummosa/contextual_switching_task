# Comparing RNN Performance with and without MD Input

## Overview

This project aims to investigate the role of Mediodorsal Thalamic Nucleus (MD) representations on the ability of the cortex (modeled as a Recurrent Neural Network, RNN) in generalization to novel situations. The codebase consists of two primary models: one that includes both the cortex and MD and another that only models the cortex (RNN only). Through a comparative study, the project sheds light on the influence of MD representations in the neural modeling context.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to begin is by executing the `run_training_testing_simple_RNN_MD` notebook, which provides a straightforward comparison between training and testing of the two primary models:

- Cortex only model (RNN only)
- Cortex + MD model
